simple captcha program:

Mostly, Captcha is used on the comment or contact form of the websites to restrict robots (bot) from commenting on a blog post or sending a message to the admin. There can be random images or codes in the captcha, and the users must have to select correct images or match the codes to complete their task.
In this small project [Custom Captcha in JavaScript], as you can see in the preview image, there is an image with the random 6 characters and numbers. You can also refresh the captcha code and get a new one using the reload button.

In the input field, you have to enter the captcha codes that are shown on the image. If your codes matched with the captcha codes, then there is appears a success message else there appears an error message. If youâ€™ve matched the codes, then after 4 seconds there will be generated a new one captcha code.
